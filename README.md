[JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) deployed as a static site to GitHub Pages,
for use as a backup Jupyter Lab interface when delivering training courses using material from
[_Programming with Python_ Software Carpentries](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/index.html) lesson,
for participants who have trouble setting up dependencies locally.

The JupyterLite instance is set up with required dependencies for covering all episodes in lesson
- Python kernel (Pyodide)
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

The deployment is pre-loaded with the data and code in the [lesson materials](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/index.html#obtain-lesson-materials).
